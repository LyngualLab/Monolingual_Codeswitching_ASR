# Monolingual_Codeswitching_ASR
Codebase for Monolingual Code-Switched Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

This repository contains the codebase for monolingual code-switched ASR, leveraging an NVIDIA English monolingual model. The model has been tested on code-switched (CS) data as well as two monolingual datasets to evaluate its robustness in handling mixed-language speech.
